# simpleapp

I had really tight deadlines, so decisions were made to neglect something.

I decided to put almost all attention to application's architecture. So now, it was easy to expand and upgrade. Also some figma's details unclear, so fully creativities mode on :)

Put attention: 
1. Layout architecture.
2. Interfaced applications layers
3. Nice ux(somewhere, not everywhere)
4. VUEX modules auto importing
5. Reusable components

Neglected: 
1. Not pixel-perfect (no time)
2. Responsive design
3. A lot of button disabled(header, some actions)
4. Really important build architecture with icons(current is really bad)
5. More types...
6. Updating user story

I hope this test showed I am business oriented (with deadlines), also had backlog, and not bad code :)

Have a good time!
