I had really tight deadlines, so decisions were made to neglect something.

You give so blured task description, so I decided to put almost all attention to application's architecture. So now, it was easy to expand and upgrade. Also
some figma's details unclear, so fully creativities mode on :)

Put attention:

1. Layout architecture.
2. Interfaced applications layers
3. Nice ux(somewhere, not everywhere)
4. VUEX modules auto importing
5. Reusable components

Neglected:

1. Not pixel-perfect (no time)
2. Responsive design
3. A lot of button disabled(header, some actions)
4. Really important build architecture with icons(current is really bad)
5. More types...
6. Updating user story
7. Validating fields
8. Script setup not everywhere :( (code cleaning requires)
9. Modules vuex not typisated
10. No fonts from figma

I hope this test showed I am business oriented (with deadlines) and proficient with vue architecture enough. In my
opinion this is much more difficult, than pixel-perfecting and other 'mechanic' stuff; also I had backlog, and not
bad code :)

Have a good time!
